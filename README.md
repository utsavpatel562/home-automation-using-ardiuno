## Project Overview
This repository contains the code and design files for a home automation system built with Arduino. The system allows users to control various aspects of their home, such as lights, temperature, and security, through an IoT interface. The project is designed to be flexible, scalable, and easy to set up.

## Features
- Remote control of lights and other appliances
- Temperature and humidity monitoring
- Security features like door/window sensors
- Integration with IoT platforms for remote monitoring and control

## Getting Started
To set up this project, you'll need the following hardware components:
- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno, Mega)
- Sensors (e.g., DHT11 for temperature/humidity, PIR for motion detection)
- Actuators (e.g., relays for lights/appliances)
- Connectivity module (e.g., ESP8266 for Wi-Fi)
- Breadboard and jumper wires

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following software installed:
- Arduino IDE
- Required Arduino libraries (listed below)

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/home-automation-system.git
